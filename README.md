RP every .scad in this directory once.
Aim for 0.3mm layers and 2.2 extrusion width (width over thickness),
for 0.66mm stroke width, with 2 perimeters. Bot is tested at this setting.

Your printer should be able to do 5cm bridges.

All comments assume you are looking at the bot from the side of motors
